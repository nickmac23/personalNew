  mainContent: '  Whereabouts is a community-powered map for overlooked points-of-interest that was created as part of a week long group project. It captures hidden gems that only a true local would know, giving the user a more authentic experience than what other travel sites can offer. To create an entry a user can simply whip out their phone, and use Google maps API to lock onto their location. All posts are saved in a postgresql database which can be filtered and viewed by location and distance. Popular posts are upvoted allowing for community reliability and more exciting points of interest to be displayed to the user quicker.I created this project prior to me learning Angular. With the goal to seamlessly render new information to the page without a refresh I utilized socket.io and jQuery. Whereabouts gets its charm from its content and is in desperate need of more. Please visit the site and add your own. For more information about where I have been visit' ,

This game is a remake of Atari's Asteroids, an arcade style game in which a spaceship fights for survival in an asteroid field. Gameplay was made entirely using the HTML5 canvas element and JavaScript. Additionally I used CSS, SASS and Jquery for styling the site. The game includes four different ships, three asteroid types with different behaviors and an updating score tally. Userâ€™s high scores  are saved and compared in a Firebase database which I utilize for creating a high score leader board. Click below to visit the site and see if you can get the new high score. I hope you enjoy the game.",
